The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) gcc/10.2.0 => gcc/13.0.1

WARNING!
  Very diffused basis functions are found in the basis set. They may lead to severe
  linear dependence and numerical instability.  You can set  cell.exp_to_discard=0.1
  to remove the diffused Gaussians whose exponents are less than 0.1.
